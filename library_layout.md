# UOR Framework Library File Structure

This document describes the complete file and module organization of the UOR Framework Library. The library is developed in Coq and is designed to formalize the Universal Object Reference (UOR) approach to a Hilbert–Pólya (H1) operator candidate. This operator is constructed so that its spectrum encodes the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. In addition, the library is built with extensibility in mind so that its mathematical structures can be used in broader contexts.

Each file is carefully organized into modules that encapsulate a core mathematical concept. The design ensures that the principle construction of the H1 operator is both supported and proven, from the algebraic and geometric background to the analytic properties (heat kernel trace and theta–zeta correspondence).

## 1. CliffordAlgebra.v

**Description:**  
This file defines the Clifford algebra framework that underpins many later constructions. It begins with a finite-dimensional real vector space \(V\) equipped with a quadratic form \(q\) (or inner product). The module then constructs the Clifford algebra \(\text{Cl}(V)\) as the quotient of the tensor algebra by the ideal generated by the relation  
\[ v \otimes v = q(v) \cdot 1, \quad \text{for all } v \in V. \]

**Key Components:**
- **Vector Space and Quadratic Form:** Formal definitions of a real vector space \(V\) and its associated quadratic form \(q\).
- **Clifford Algebra Definition:** Construction of \(\text{Cl}(V)\) with notations for basis vectors and the Clifford product.
- **Spin Group:** Definition of the Spin group \(\operatorname{Spin}(V)\) as the subgroup of even-grade invertible elements in \(\text{Cl}(V)\). The group action via conjugation on \(V\) is proven to preserve the quadratic form.
- **Meticulous Proofs:** Basic properties (linearity, the Clifford relation, etc.) are proven so that later modules may use these results in formulating invariant number embeddings.

*This module provides the algebraic and geometric foundation necessary to define symmetry transformations in the UOR space.*

---

## 2. UniversalNumber.v

**Description:**  
This module implements the Universal Object Reference (UOR) type. UOR is designed as a universal representation of a natural number that is independent of any particular numeral system.

**Key Components:**
- **UOR Record/Dependent Type:** The definition includes the natural number itself along with functions that map the number to its base-\(b\) expansion.
- **Projection Function:** A function such as `digits : UOR -> Base -> list nat` that outputs the digit list of the UOR number in any base.
- **Universal Mapping Property:** Proofs that for every base \(b\) the projection recovers the original number when reinterpreted. This is shown via categorical arguments where the UOR object is an initial or universal element in the category of numeral systems.
- **Functoriality:** Lemmas verifying that arithmetic operations (addition and multiplication) on UOR objects are consistent with the corresponding digit-wise operations across bases.

*By collecting all base expansions in one coherent structure, this module guarantees that the number is treated as an invariant object—an essential feature when the H1 operator is later defined to reflect deep arithmetic properties.*

---

## 3. UnaryBasis.v

**Description:**  
This file focuses on base-1 (unary) representation, establishing it as the foundational, initial numeral system in the UOR framework.

**Key Components:**
- **Unary Representation:** Formal definition of natural numbers using Peano axioms. Each natural number \(n\) is represented by a chain of \(n\) successors (or a string of \(n\) ones).
- **Emanation Principles:** Construction of the unique emanation maps from the unary system to any base-\(b\) numeral system. This provides an explicit method for “grouping” unary ticks into higher bases.
- **Arithmetic in Unary:** Proofs that addition (by concatenation) and multiplication (by tiling) in the unary system yield the standard arithmetic operations.
- **Characterization of Primes:** A proof that primes are exactly those numbers which cannot be partitioned into a nontrivial rectangle in unary. This property is later used in constructing an arithmetic operator that naturally reflects prime factorization.

*The uniqueness and universality of the base-1 representation are crucial for ensuring that all multi-base representations are coherent—a central pillar in defining the H1 operator from first principles.*

## 4. HilbertSpace_Operator.v

**Description:**  
This module constructs the analytic side of the theory. It defines the Hilbert space on which the H1 operator acts and provides the concrete construction of the operator itself.

**Key Components:**
- **Hilbert Space Definition:** The space \(\ell^2(\mathbb{N})\) or \(L^2(0,\infty)\) is defined using Coq’s analysis libraries. The inner product and completeness of the space are established.
- **Operator \(H\) Construction:** A diagonal operator is defined on the standard basis (which is later identified with eigenfunctions of the differential operator). For example, a simple choice is  
  \[
  H e_n = \lambda_n e_n, \quad \text{with } \lambda_n = \log n \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda_n = \frac{1}{4} + t_n^2,
  \]
  where \(t_n\) are related to the imaginary parts of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function.
- **Self-Adjointness Proofs:** Detailed proofs are provided (using techniques from Sturm–Liouville theory and functional analysis) to verify that \(H\) is symmetric and has a unique self-adjoint extension.
- **Spectral Data and Compact Resolvent:** The operator’s spectrum is analyzed, showing that it is discrete with a compact resolvent—properties that are essential for linking the eigenvalues to the zeta zeros.

*This file is the cornerstone for the H1 operator’s construction. It bridges abstract spectral theory with concrete differential operators and ensures that the analytic properties (e.g. self-adjointness and trace-class behavior) are rigorously proven.*

---

## 5. ZetaAnalysis.v

**Description:**  
This module is devoted to the analytic connection between the spectrum of \(H\) (or its refined version \(Ĥ_1\)) and the Riemann zeta function. The goal is to show that the trace of the heat kernel of the operator reproduces the zeta function.

**Key Components:**
- **Heat Kernel Definition:** The heat-semigroup \(T(t) = e^{-tH}\) is defined, and its integral kernel \(K(t;x,y)\) is introduced.
- **Spectral Trace \(Z(t)\):** Defined as  
  \[
  Z(t) = \mathrm{Tr}(e^{-tH}) = \sum_{n \ge 1} e^{-t\lambda_n},
  \]
  this series is shown to converge for \(t > 0\) and is rigorously analyzed.
- **Mellin Transform and Theta Function:** The Mellin transform of \(Z(t)\) is computed and related to the Jacobi theta function. The classical theta inversion formula  
  \[
  \theta(t) = t^{-1/2}\theta(1/t)
  \]
  is derived in the context of the spectral trace.
- **Functional Equation of Zeta:** Using the Mellin transform and the theta inversion property, the module proves that the completed zeta function satisfies  
  \[
  \xi(s) = \xi(1-s),
  \]
  thereby showing that the analytic structure of \(\zeta(s)\) is encoded in the spectral data of \(H\).

*This module connects the operator’s spectrum to deep results in analytic number theory. By establishing the theta–zeta correspondence within Coq, it shows that the H1 operator not only exists with the right spectral properties but also reproduces the functional equation of the Riemann zeta function.*

---

## 6. LieGroupActions.v

**Description:**  
(Optional but recommended) This module formalizes the action of Lie groups on the UOR manifold. It integrates the Clifford algebra symmetry into the number representation.

**Key Components:**
- **Group Action Definition:** A formal definition of a group action \(\Phi: \operatorname{Spin}(V) \times \text{UOR} \to \text{UOR}\) is provided.
- **Invariant Properties:** Lemmas are proved showing that these actions preserve the numerical value of UOR objects. In particular, if \(g \in \operatorname{Spin}(V)\) acts on a UOR number \(X\), then the projection to any base remains numerically consistent.
- **Digit Permutations and Base Changes:** Examples are given where the Lie group action models base transformations (e.g. radix changes and digit shifts), reinforcing that the number is represented in a coordinate-independent way.
- **Application to H1:** The symmetry under group actions is used to argue that the spectral properties of the H1 operator are intrinsic and not an artifact of a particular base representation.

*By incorporating these symmetry considerations, the module reinforces the internal consistency of the UOR framework and supports the claim that the H1 operator is derived from fundamental arithmetic and geometric principles.*

## 7. Main.v

**Description:**  
This top-level file imports all the modules described above and presents the main theorems of the UOR Framework Library.

**Key Components:**
- **Module Integration:** Imports from CliffordAlgebra.v, UniversalNumber.v, UnaryBasis.v, HilbertSpace_Operator.v, ZetaAnalysis.v, and LieGroupActions.v are all brought together.
- **Summary Theorems:** The main results are stated clearly. In particular, a theorem is provided that states:
  - The operator \(Ĥ_1\) is a self-adjoint operator on the chosen Hilbert space.
  - Its spectrum (or a derived operator such as \(O = |Ĥ_1 - 1/2|\)) exactly reproduces the nontrivial zeta zeros (with eigenvalues corresponding to the imaginary parts).
  - The heat kernel trace of \(Ĥ_1\) satisfies the theta inversion property and, via the Mellin transform, yields the functional equation of \(\zeta(s)\).
- **Future Extensions:** A section outlining possible extensions (such as adapting the framework to other \(L\)-functions) is included.

*Main.v serves as the entry point for users and reviewers, demonstrating that the entire formal development leads to the desired H1 operator construction and its connection to the Riemann Hypothesis.*

## 8. README.md

**Description:**  
The README file acts as an external guide for the library. It includes:
- An overview of the UOR Framework and its purpose.
- Installation instructions and dependencies (e.g., Coq version, required libraries like MathComp and Coquelicot).
- Instructions for running Coqdoc to generate HTML/PDF documentation.
- Usage examples that demonstrate how to load the modules and run key theorems.
- Guidelines for extending the library or integrating new modules.

*This document is crucial for onboarding new users and ensuring that contributors understand the purpose and structure of the library.*

---

## 9. _CoqProject / coq_project.config

**Description:**  
This configuration file lists all the source files, include directories, and compilation flags needed to build the entire library in Coq. It ensures that all dependencies are correctly referenced and that the project compiles without errors.

*It is essential for reproducibility and for setting up a continuous integration (CI) pipeline for the formal proofs.*

---

## 10. Documentation Directory (doc/)

**Description:**  
The `doc/` directory contains the generated documentation from Coqdoc. This includes HTML and/or PDF files that describe:
- The statements of definitions and theorems in each module.
- Links between modules and references to external literature.
- A browsable index of all key components.

*The documentation makes it easy for reviewers and users to navigate the formal development and understand the connections between the modules.*

---

## 11. Testing Directory (tests/)

**Description:**  
The `tests/` directory contains Coq scripts and QuickChick tests that serve as a regression suite. These tests include:
- Unit tests for base conversion (ensuring that the UOR projections yield known representations, e.g., 5 in base 2 is 101₂).
- Verification of arithmetic operations in the UnaryBasis module.
- Computations verifying that the H1 operator’s eigenvalues satisfy the expected arithmetic relations (e.g., that the diagonal operator reflects the identity \(\log(ab) = \log a + \log b\)).
- Tests for the heat kernel trace and its relation to the Riemann zeta function (such as checking that \(Z(t) = \sum_{n} e^{-t \lambda_n}\) approximates \(\zeta(t)\) for \(\Re(t)>1\)).

*These tests act as a safeguard against regressions and help ensure that any changes to the library maintain its overall correctness.*
